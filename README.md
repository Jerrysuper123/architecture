# architecture

Good question — in **microservices**, **data loss** isn't common per se, but it's definitely a **risk**, especially during **inter-service communication** or **synchronization**, depending on how things are designed.

Here are some **common causes of data loss or inconsistency** between components:

---

### 🔄 **1. Sync Failures (Async Communication)**
- If you use message brokers like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or SNS/SQS for async communication and:
  - A message gets published, but the consumer crashes or fails to process it
  - No proper **acknowledgement** / **retry** strategy is in place
  - Messages are not **durable/persisted**
  
💡 **Solution**: Use **durable queues**, **retry logic**, and **dead-letter queues (DLQs)** to capture failed events.

---

### ⚡ **2. Synchronous API Failures**
- Service A calls Service B via REST/gRPC, but:
  - Service B is down
  - There's a timeout
  - There’s a network partition

If Service A proceeds thinking the call succeeded, you get **partial updates** → classic **data inconsistency**.

💡 **Solution**: Use patterns like **circuit breakers**, **retries with backoff**, or **sagas** for better resilience.

---

### ⚙️ **3. Lack of Idempotency**
- If retries are not idempotent (e.g. inserting a row again instead of updating), you can get data corruption or duplication.

💡 **Solution**: Ensure **idempotent operations** (same request → same result, no side effects).

---

### 📦 **4. No Distributed Transaction Handling**
- Microservices typically avoid distributed transactions (2PC) because of complexity and tight coupling.
- Without a strategy like **Saga pattern**, one service might commit a change, but the others don’t → inconsistent data state.

💡 **Solution**: Implement **saga orchestration** or **choreography** to handle failures across multiple services in a business process.

---

### 📜 **5. Versioning or Schema Drift**
- If one service updates its schema but another isn't updated, you might silently drop fields or misinterpret data.

💡 **Solution**: Use **backward/forward-compatible schemas** (e.g. Avro, Protobuf) and enforce **versioning discipline**.

---

### ✅ TL;DR:
- **Data loss isn’t expected**, but can happen due to **network issues**, **bad error handling**, or **missing retry/durability mechanisms**.
- Prevent it using: **durable messaging**, **idempotency**, **saga patterns**, and **robust error handling**.

### 🔄 **Current Approach: Using SQL/NoSQL Tables to Communicate Between Microservices**

#### ✅ What's Happening
You're currently:
- Creating **custom database tables**.
- One service writes data to a table.
- Another service **polls** the table to read/process the data.
- Doing this for each new integration or feature.

#### ❌ Why It’s Painful
- **Not scalable**: Every new feature or integration = new table/schema changes.
- **High latency**: Polling DBs introduces unnecessary load and delays.
- **Complex maintenance**: Managing retries, failure states, and cleanup manually.
- **Tight coupling**: Services know too much about each other’s data structures.

### ✅ **Proposed Improvement: Using Cloud Queue for Inter-Service Communication**

Cloud **Queue** is part of the **Cloud Messaging Service**, designed for **asynchronous, decoupled communication** between microservices.

---

### 🔁 What Cloud Queue Brings to the Table

| Feature | Benefit |
|--------|--------|
| **Message-based** | Services send/receive discrete messages instead of managing tables. |
| **Decoupled** | Producers and consumers don’t need to know each other’s structure. |
| **Scalable** | Add new queues instead of tables; queues are managed resources. |
| **Durable & Reliable** | Messages are persisted with retry and DLQ (dead letter queue) support. |
| **No polling delays** | Supports long-polling and near real-time delivery. |
| **Security & IAM** | Integrated with Cloud IAM policies for secure access control. |

---

### 🧠 Typical Flow Using Cloud Queue

1. **Service A (Producer)** publishes a message to an Cloud Queue.
2. **Service B (Consumer)** reads messages from the queue asynchronously or via polling.
3. Queue ensures **at-least-once delivery**, optionally FIFO.
4. Messages are **acknowledged**, retried, or moved to **DLQ** if not processed.

---

### 🔄 SQL Table vs Cloud Queue: A Quick Visual

```
[Service A] --> INSERT INTO table --> [Service B polls table] (delay, overhead)

vs

[Service A] --> PUT Message in Cloud Queue --> [Service B gets message] (event-driven)
```

---

## database are not meant for polling or constant status update
Due to downsides:
- there is a delay between when data is written. and when it's read. If polling every 10 second, we are missing the real data in 10 second, that is latency
- put extra load on the database, not designed like message broker, slow down the overall system as more services and checks are added
- does not scale as app grows

A better way is to use event-driven messaging
- it is like switching from refreshing your inbox constantly to just getting notifications when email arrives.

  Great! Here's what that line means, broken down clearly:

---

### 📦 "Messages are persisted with retry and DLQ (dead letter queue) support" means:

#### ✅ **1. Messages are persisted**
- Messages sent to the cloud Queue are **stored reliably**.
- If the consumer service isn't available right away, the message is **not lost**.
- It stays in the queue until:
  - It's successfully processed.
  - It expires (based on retention period).
  - Or it's moved to the DLQ (more on that below).

Think of it like a **mailbox that keeps the letter safe** until someone picks it up.

---

#### 🔁 **2. Retry support**
- If a consumer **fails to process a message** (e.g. service crash, error), cloud can:
  - **Retry delivery** automatically.
  - You can configure the number of retries.
- This improves reliability — messages don’t just disappear if something goes wrong once.

Example:  
Your service tries to process a message but hits a network error → cloud can **retry a few times** before giving up.

---

#### 🪦 **3. DLQ = Dead Letter Queue**
- If a message **fails too many times** (after all retry attempts), it is moved to a **Dead Letter Queue**.
- This is like a **quarantine zone** for "bad" messages.
- You can inspect the DLQ later to:
  - Debug the issue.
  - Fix or reprocess failed messages.
  - Avoid data loss.

---

### 🧠 Why this matters:
Without this, you'd have to build your own logic to:
- Retry on failure.
- Track failed messages.
- Avoid losing important data.

Cloud Queue gives you all this **out of the box** — just set it up in the config.

## Queue and channel
- queue is queue of message to be processed
- channels are paths for task/message to be filtered and delegate

# what is cloud stream
- like kafka - store vent logs in partition
- services can replay and consume independantly
- highly throughput
- event driven architecture, large scale ingestion

# what is cloud topic (notification)
- it is a pub/sub model
- push msg to
- email
- sms
- https endpoint
- functions
- Useful for sending alerts, broadcasting updates, triggering actions.

Great follow-up! Let's break it down simply:

## 🧠 What is **Kafka**?

**Apache Kafka** is an **open-source distributed event streaming platform**.

### In simple terms:
It’s like a **giant real-time logbook** where systems can:
- ✍️ **Write** events (producers)
- 📖 **Read** events (consumers)
- 📂 Keep events for a while (retention)

It's used to **decouple** services, handle **massive volumes of data**, and enable **real-time data pipelines**.

## 📦 Kafka Core Concepts (at a glance)

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Producer** | App that writes (publishes) messages |
| **Consumer** | App that reads (subscribes to) messages |
| **Topic** | Named channel of messages (like a stream or folder) |
| **Partition** | A topic can be split into partitions for parallelism |
| **Offset** | A message's position in a partition |
| **Broker** | A Kafka server that stores and serves messages |
| **Consumer Group** | A group of consumers that work together to process messages |

---

## 📈 Why Do People Use Kafka?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **High throughput** | Can handle millions of events/sec |
| **Real-time** | Low-latency message processing |
| **Durable** | Messages are stored safely (disk-backed) |
| **Replayable** | Consumers can re-read old messages |
| **Scalable** | Add more brokers, partitions, consumers |
| **Decoupled systems** | Producers and consumers don’t need to know about each other |

---

## 🧪 Example: E-commerce App

1. **User places order** → event sent to `orders` topic
2. **Inventory service** consumes `orders` topic → updates stock
3. **Billing service** consumes `orders` topic → processes payment
4. **Email service** consumes `orders` topic → sends confirmation

They all subscribe to the same topic, but work independently.

## ☁️ Kafka in the Cloud

Instead of managing Kafka yourself (which can be complex), cloud platforms offer **managed Kafka-like services**:

| Cloud | Kafka Equivalent |
|-------|------------------|
| **Oracle Cloud (OCI)** | **OCI Streaming (Kafka-compatible)** |
| **AWS** | Amazon MSK |
| **Azure** | Azure Event Hubs |
| **Google Cloud** | Confluent Cloud / PubSub |

---

## 🧠 TL;DR:

> Kafka is a **high-performance, durable, event streaming system** used to connect services and process data in real time.

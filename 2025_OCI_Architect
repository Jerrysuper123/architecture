# Intro
Terraform
What is cloud native

•    Architect High Availability and Disaster Recovery Solutions
•    Become proficient in designing Cloud-Native Solutions and implementing Infrastructure as Code
•    Implement and operate databases in OCI
•    Architect Security Solutions
•    Design multicloud and hybrid solutions
•    Perform workload migration to OCI
•    Implement Observability solutions

Prerequisites: You need to have a good understanding of core OCI services (Identity and Access Management, Networking, Compute and Storage). Additionally, a minimum of 1-2 years of hands-on experience with OCI services is recommended.

Skills you will learn:

•    High Availability and Disaster Recovery : Full Stack Disaster Recovery service
•    Cloud-Native Solutions : Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry, Container Instances ,Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE), Functions and API Gateway
•    Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Resource Manager 
•    Security services: OCI Bastion, Network Firewall, Certificates, Web Application Firewall, KMS
•    Databases: Base Database service, Autonomous Databases
•    Migration: Oracle Cloud Migrations, migrate data and databases to OCI
•    Multicloud and Hybrid: OCI-Azure Interconnect, Oracle Database@Azure, Oracle Cloud VMWare Solution
•    Observability: Monitoring, Logging

## IAM refresher (identiy and access management)

- identity domain - iolsated partition within OCI (reforce password)
- Users/groups, streamlining access control
- administrator roles 
- IAM policies (syntax, policy actions, and placement)
- Compartments
- Quota/budgets (how to set quota and budget to management resource efficiently)
- Granular acccess control (policy inheritance, conditional policies, tag-based access control)

policy inheriance - policy can inherit policy from parent compartment
conditional policies - policy to be exe based on conditions
tag-based access control

- network source (how to restrict access to resource based on specific ip address and virtual cloud network)
- dynamic groups
